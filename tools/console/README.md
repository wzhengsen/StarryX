## Vision of adxe-console


A command line tool that lets you create, run, publish, debug, etcâ€¦ your game. It is the swiss-army knife for adxe.

This command line tool is in its early stages.

Examples:

```
# starts a new project called "My Game" for multi-platform

$ adxe new MyGame -l cpp -p org.adxe.mygame

$ cd MyGame

# Will deploy the project to device and run it
$ adxe run -p android


```

# Devel Info

## Internals

`adxe.py` is an script whose only responsability is to call its plugins.
`adxe.bat` will invoke `adxe.py` on windows
`adxe` will invoke `adxe.py` on Mac OS X and linux

To get a list of all the registered plugins:

```
$ adxe
```

To run the "new" plugin:

```
$ adxe new
``` 

## Adding a new plugin to the console

You have to edit `bin/adxe.ini`, and add the class name of your new plugin there. Let's say that you want to add a plugin that deploys the project:


```
# should be a subclass of CCPlugin
project_deploy.CCPluginDeploy
``` 

And now you have to create a file called `project_deploy.py` in the `plugins` folder.
A new, empty plugin, would look like the code shown below:

```
import cocos

# Plugins should be a sublass of CCPlugin
class CCPluginDeploy(cocos.CCPlugin):

		# in default category
        @staticmethod
        def plugin_category():
          return ""

        @staticmethod
        def plugin_name():
          return "deploy"

        @staticmethod
        def brief_description():
            return "Deploy the project to target."                

        def run(self, argv, dependencies):
            print "plugin called!"
            print argv

```

Plugins are divided by category, depending on it's function: project, engine, ...

The plugins of `project` is in default category, it's an empty stirng `""`.

# Generate Executable

Now you can use the `toexec/build_console.py` for generating a executable file of `cocos` command.

## Environment Requirement

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org) (2.7.5 is well tested)
* [PyInstaller](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyInstaller) (PyInstaller 2.1 is well tested)
* Necessary PATH environment for python & pyinstaller.

__Attention:To keep compatible with both Windows-32bit & Windows-64bit, please install 32bit python on Windows.__

## Steps

Run `python build_console.py` in command line. Then the executable file & necessary files will be generated in `toexec/output/PLATFORM`.

The usage of `build_console.py`:

```
usage: build_console.py [-h] [-s SRC_PATH] [-d DST_PATH]

Generate executable file for adxe-console by PyInstaller.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SRC_PATH, --src-path SRC_PATH
                        Specify the path of adxe-console.
  -d DST_PATH, --dst-path DST_PATH
                        Specify the path of output.
```

## Using the Executable

The generated executable files can replace the source code of adxe-console.

To fit the limitation of the adxe-console implementation. The generated executable files should located at `ENGINE_PATH/tools/console/bin`.

Then you can use the executable file as same as the source code.
